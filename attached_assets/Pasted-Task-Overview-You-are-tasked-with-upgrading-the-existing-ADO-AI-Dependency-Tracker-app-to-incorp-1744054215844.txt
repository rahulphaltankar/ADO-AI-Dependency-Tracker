Task Overview:
You are tasked with upgrading the existing "ADO AI Dependency Tracker" app to incorporate Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and other features described in the research paper. Ensure the app complies with ethical AI practices, GDPR standards, scalability requirements, and provides explainable AI insights.
1. Incorporate Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
Objective: Add PINN-based functionality to model task dependencies using governing equations derived from project management theories (e.g., Brooks’ Law, Critical Chain Theory).

Steps:

Implement PINN architecture using PyTorch or TensorFlow. Refer to GitHub PINNs repository for examples.

Define partial differential equations (PDEs) for task dependencies:

Brooks’ Law: Communication overhead modeled as nonlinear PDE terms.

Critical Chain Theory: Buffer limits encoded as PDE boundary conditions.

Integrate these PDEs into the loss function of the neural network:

Train the PINN model using historical Azure DevOps data (e.g., task descriptions, resource allocation).

2. Address Ethical Considerations
Objective: Ensure fairness in dependency tracking and compliance with GDPR standards.

Steps:

Implement bias-aware optimization techniques:

Regularize dependency weights to minimize disparities between urban and rural teams.

Use Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss to compare bias metrics across teams:

L
bias
=
M

(

,
β
team B
)
L

 =MSE(β

 ,β

 )
Anonymize sensitive data such as user information and task descriptions using SHA-3 hashing before processing it with AI models.

Add an opt-out mechanism for users whose data is being analyzed, ensuring GDPR compliance.

3. Enhance Scalability
Objective: Optimize the app for resource-constrained environments like SMEs.

Steps:

Apply post-training quantization techniques (e.g., 8-bit quantization using TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Quantization Toolkit) to reduce computational requirements for CPU-only environments.

Implement sparse optimization methods to reduce memory usage while maintaining performance.

Provide a lightweight mode that simplifies features for small teams with limited resources.

4. Integrate Explainability Tools
Objective: Add explainability features to help users understand AI predictions and decisions.

Steps:

Integrate Grad-CAM visualizations into the React frontend using libraries like D3.js or Plotly.js.

Grad-CAM provides heatmaps showing which parts of input data influenced dependency risk predictions.

Add textual explanations alongside visualizations in dashboards to describe how risk scores are calculated based on factors like team velocity and dependency complexity.

Ensure explainability tools are accessible through dynamic graphs and dashboards.

5. Update UI/UX for Enhanced Functionality
Objective: Improve user interaction with new features while maintaining intuitive design principles.

Steps:

Enhance interactive dependency visualization by incorporating critical path analysis based on PINN predictions.

Add filtering options for users to view dependencies by risk level, sprint timeline, or team allocation.

Include tooltips or annotations explaining PINN-derived insights directly within graphs and dashboards.

6. Technical Implementation Details
Use the following technology stack:

Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS for responsive UI updates incorporating explainability tools (e.g., Grad-CAM visualizations).

Backend: Express.js server with TypeScript for handling updated API endpoints related to PINN-based predictions and ethical compliance mechanisms.

AI Processing: Python-based machine learning models using PyTorch or TensorFlow for PINN implementation, bias mitigation techniques, and quantization optimizations.

Data Storage: Use a database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) to store anonymized task data and dependency metrics securely.
