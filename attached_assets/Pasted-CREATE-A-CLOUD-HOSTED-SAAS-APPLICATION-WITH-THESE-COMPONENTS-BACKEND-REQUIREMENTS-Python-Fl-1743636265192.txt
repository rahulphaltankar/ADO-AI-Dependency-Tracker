CREATE A CLOUD-HOSTED SAAS APPLICATION WITH THESE COMPONENTS:

=== BACKEND REQUIREMENTS (Python Flask) ===
- Azure DevOps API integration for:
  - Work item retrieval (Epics/User Stories/Tasks)
  - Pull Request status monitoring
  - Sprint timeline data extraction
- Natural Language Processing system using:
  - spaCy for dependency phrase detection ("Blocked by", "Requires", "Depends on")
  - OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for contextual analysis of free-text fields
- Machine Learning Model:
  - Scikit-learn regression model trained on historical sprint data
  - Predicts delay risk % based on:
    - Team velocity history
    - Dependency chain complexity
    - Resource allocation
- Real-Time Alert System:
  - Slack/Teams webhook integration
  - Threshold-based notifications (e.g., "Risk >75%")
- Automated Dependency Graph Builder:
  - NetworkX for dependency chain analysis
  - Export to D3.js compatible JSON format

=== FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS (React.js) ===
- Interactive Visualization Dashboard:
  - D3.js force-directed graph for dependency mapping
  - Heatmap showing risk distribution across teams
  - Gantt-style sprint timeline with risk overlays
- Azure DevOps-like Interface:
  - Work item board with AI-generated dependency tags
  - Quick action buttons for dependency management
- AI Input Console:
  - Text area for manual dependency analysis
  - Example placeholders:
    "This feature requires API v2 from Sprint 5"
    "Blocked until DevOps completes pipeline setup"
- Configuration Panel:
  - ADO connection setup wizard
  - Alert threshold sliders (60-90% risk)
  - Team velocity history upload

=== REPLIT CONFIGURATION ===
- Auto-Install These Packages:
  Python:
  flask>=2.0.1
  flask-cors>=3.0.10
  spacy>=3.7.4
  scikit-learn>=1.4.0
  python-dotenv>=1.0.0
  openai>=1.12.0
  networkx>=3.2.1

  JavaScript:
  d3@7.8.5
  @microsoft/teams-js@2.7.0
  axios@1.6.2
  react-flow@11.7.0
  
- Environment Template:
  ADO_ORG="your-organization-name"
  ADO_PROJECT="your-project-name" 
  ADO_TOKEN="base64-encoded-pat-token"
  OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
  SLACK_WEBHOOK="https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
  TEAMS_WEBHOOK="https://outlook.office.com/webhook/..."

- AI Assistant Configuration:
  Enable code completion for:
  - API error handling
  - React component scaffolding
  - ML model optimization
  
=== MOCK DATA & SAFETY FEATURES ===
1. Fallback Mode:
   - Uses sample_data.json when ADO connection fails
   - Contains 50+ realistic work items with dependencies

2. Error Prevention:
   - Input validation for all API calls
   - Rate limiting (max 5 req/sec)
   - Session auto-save every 2 minutes

3. Beginner Safety Nets:
   - Code rollback via "/revert" command
   - Visual warnings for misconfigured ENV vars
   - One-click dependency installer

=== SAMPLE TEST SCENARIO ===
User Input: "We can't deploy until the database team finishes migration (Expected: Sprint 8)"  

Expected Actions:
1. NLP detects dependency on "database team" and "Sprint 8"
2. Links to actual ADO work item DB-456
3. ML model calculates:
   - 68% delay risk (based on DB team's history)
   - Potential 4-day cascade delay
4. Frontend updates:
   - Adds red edge to dependency graph
   - Shows warning icon on Sprint 8 timeline
5. Sends Teams message: 
   "New high-risk dependency: DB-456 (68%) - Review needed"
